Hi! I'm Neil - welcome to my blog! I'll be sharing my learnings over here - I think blogs are the modern day equivalent of Ramanujan's notebooks he sent to Hardy. I'm currently studying Electronics and Communications Engineering at BITS Pilani, although my interests vary. I hope you learn something from my experiences!
