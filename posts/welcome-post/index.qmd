Hi! This is starshipNeil. This a basic first post on my new blog! What will I be blogging about? Math, quantitative finance, infosec, ai/ml, puzzles and related topics. I like stuff that has to do with math, basically - it makes me feel like I\'m using my brain.

That\'s it for my first post, I\'ll try posting more as soon as I can. I\'m focusing on quality over quantity, although I also believe quantity leads to quality. It\'s a balance I\'ll have to figure out on my own. See you!
