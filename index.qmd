Hi! I'm Neil - I'm 20 years old, and I'm currently a junior at BITS Pilani majoring in Electronics and Communications Engineering. I've spent the majority of my degree not actually studying my major, and it's a decision I've come to regret - this blog is my attempt to make up for the education I missed out on (though the fault is my own).
