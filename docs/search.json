I like stuff that has to do with math, basically - it makes me feel like I'm using my brain.\nThat's it for my first post, I'll try posting more as soon as I can. I'm focusing on quality over quantity, although I also believe quantity leads to quality. It's a balance I'll have to figure out on my own. See you!"
